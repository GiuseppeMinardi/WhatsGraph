This project aims to make a program that create graphs using logs from  WhatsApp chats.
If you have any idea on other graphs that I can plot let me know!

I used *Pandas* ad *Matplotlib* in order to create the graphs, if you want to improve the algorithm branch the repository and do your best!

- Group chat analysis
    - Number of text per month (should work with group chat)
    - Average text length per month (should work with group chat)
    - Number of media sent in the chat group and number of media per person (media: images and audio files)
    - Wordcloud with each message (currently implemented only in Italian)
    - Specify an image in order to shape the wordcloud.

This is just a python script, I will look forward in order to take inputs from the command line
